# Connect

This was an iOS app I made in 2016. It has since been removed from the store,
but I have updated it to work for the latest iOS versions. It should still be
possible to install it through Xcode using a free account.

I later developed a similar Android game called [Swap](https://github.com/scott2000/swap-game),
which is still available on Google Play as of now.
